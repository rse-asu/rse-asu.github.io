 Archaeological data is inherently fragile, and unfortunately prone to loss and mismanagement. To alleviate these issues, the Center for Digital Antiquity (CDA) created The Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR), an online repository for archaeological information focused on long-term preservation and reuse. For almost 15 years tDAR has been an important archive for preserving archaeological data from around the globe, with a mission to collect and preserve datasets “indefinitely”. But how can CDA/ASU maintain such a project, and how can it be redeveloped to meet needs that were unimagined when tDAR began? The creation, maintenance, and rebuilding of this data repository requires a blend of engineering, policy, fundraising, daily maintenance, and far-seeing vision. tDAR is currently guided by its third “generation” of developers and directors who are preparing for its largest expansion since its inception and original deployment. This presentation highlights the Center’s cyber infrastructure and how they have created and maintained this important archival service and how they are preparing for its next 20 years of use and growth.
