Sound science depends on reproducible and transparent results, whether from physical experiments in the laboratory or numerical experiments on a computer. Yet, in the latter case, standards for numerical models have largely been determined by individual researchers, with many scientists treating their code as proprietary software. However, the adoption of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles has driven a significant push in the scientific community to ensure that scientific modeling meets the most rigorous standards for reproducibility and transparency. In this talk, I examine how an open-source framework enables researchers to achieve these standards. I present a case study from the field of hydrology, documenting current efforts to transition a legacy hydrology model to meet open-source standards. Along the way, I discuss the pitfalls and challenges encountered in this effort, as well as a vision for the future of this model within an open-source ecosystem. In this ecosystem, collective progress and discovery are accelerated by shared knowledge, community engagement, and collaborative innovation.
