ASU’s experienced Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are here to help!

🔍 **What we offer:**  
 ✔ Expert review by ASU RSEs  
 ✔ A focused 45-minute consultation  
 ✔ Actionable notes and guidance  

🚫 **What we don’t offer:**  
 ✘ Implementation or coding work  
 ✘ Full code reviews  
 ✘ Help with homework assignments or coding projects that are not related to research

⏱️ These RSE consultation services are available until **the end of 2025** in order to assess the needs of ASU’s research community. We’re exploring the possibility of offering paid RSE services in the future. Consultations are currently provided by volunteers of [ASU-RSE](https://rse.asu.edu/) and do not indicate any formal commitment to further engagement.
